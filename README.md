This program written in python follows the same rules as the game Hangman. You get six attempts to guess the secret word. 
The secret word is chosen from a list of 64,000 words in a txt file. This program also keeps track of how many attempts it took to complete one game.

**TIP: Set SaveData.txt = 0 before playing to keep accurate track of the attempts made.
